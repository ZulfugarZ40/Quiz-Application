Quiz Application
Java, IntelliJ
Built a console-based quiz application featuring multiple-choice questions with 4 options each.
Utilized 2 classes along with the Map interface and HashMap class to manage questions and answers.
The program presents questions sequentially, provides instant feedback on user responses (correct/wrong),
and displays the final score with the total count of correct and incorrect answers and the percentage result.
